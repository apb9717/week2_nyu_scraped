# week2_NYU_Scraped

A Python project to scrape what startup founders consider to be some of the most valuable content online today: Paul Graham articles.

# Overview

This feature returns a list of five random Paul Graham articles from his archive. This helps

- mitigate the decision paralysis that one might receive when they see the full list and
- expose the user to articles they might not have otherwise found.

# Setup Instructions

Install the necessary packages listed in requirements.txt with "pip install -r requirements.txt".

# Usage

Simply run the program and five random articles will be generated in the print out.

# Notes

I sincerely hope nobody else used this website.
