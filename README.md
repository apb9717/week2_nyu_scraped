# week2_NYU_Scraped

A Python project to scrape what startup founders consider to be some of the most valuable content online today: Paul Graham articles.

# Overview

This feature returns a list of five random Paul Graham articles from his archive. This helps

- mitigate the decision paralysis that one might receive when they see the full list and
- expose the user to articles they might not have otherwise found.

# Setup Instructions

First, set up a Python virtual environment by first running "python -m venv .venv" then running

- ".venv\Scripts\activate" on Windows
- "source .venv/bin/activate" on Mac

Verify that the terminal prefix is (.venv) to demonstrate that you have successfully set up the virtual environment.
Then, install the necessary packages listed in requirements.txt with "pip install -r requirements.txt".

# Usage

Simply run the program and five random articles will be generated in the print out.

# Notes

I sincerely hope nobody else used this website. We had some back and forth throughout the process on what site to go with (in part due to the 25 point stipulation and in part based on what we were able to actually accomplish), but we felt that this had a somewhat high chance of being unique.
